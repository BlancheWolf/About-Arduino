# About-Arduino

Arduino is a microcomputer, you can use this to program things,
I have light up some led :)

But this little microcomputer can do much more than only light up a led...

It can help some people who are missing a leg, but the technology is not so fast as we think...
It takes dozens of years when we are there were we want, but than are some new things conceived

We can help the world by using technology and think about more than only the humans!
With Arduino we can help the nature by using more sun-energy
